# [8.4.0-projections.0] - 2021-4-7 [PR: #55](https://github.com/dolittle/DotNET.SDK/pull/55)

# [8.3.2] - 2021-3-24 [PR: #52](https://github.com/dolittle/DotNET.SDK/pull/52)
## Summary

Following async/await guidelines the RunContinuationsAsynchronously flag should always be set when creating TaskCompletionSource

# [8.3.1] - 2021-2-22 [PR: #51](https://github.com/dolittle/DotNET.SDK/pull/51)
## Summary

The CorrelationId of the ExecutionContext was never changed, which means that everything would happen under the same CorrelationId. 

This fixes it by setting the CorrelationId to a new guid whenever doing ForTenant on EventStoreBuilder  


### Changed

- Create new execution context with random guid when doing ForTenant on EventStoreBuilder


# [8.3.0] - 2021-2-17 [PR: #50](https://github.com/dolittle/DotNET.SDK/pull/50)
## Summary

Adds the EventType property to the EventContext class that's used In event handlers and filters. I think that the EventType of the event to be handled should be easily accessible. I think it fits well inside the context of the event, EventContext. Since we can commit events in a raw format (with no association between Type and EventType) we need to have the ability to know the EventType of the event you are handing in a filter or event handler

### Added

- EventType Type read-only property on EventContext


# [8.2.0] - 2021-2-17 [PR: #49](https://github.com/dolittle/DotNET.SDK/pull/49)
## Summary
