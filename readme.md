## Visual Studio

You can open the `.sln` file in the root of the repository and just build directly.

## VSCode

From the `Build` submdoule there is also a .vscode folder that gets a symbolic link for the root. This means you can open the
root of the repository directly in Visual Studio Code and start building. There are quite a few build tasks, so click F1 and type "Run Tasks" and select the "Tasks: Run Tasks"
option and then select the build task you want to run. It is folder sensitive and will look for the nearest `.csproj` file based on the file you have open.
If it doesn't find it, it will pick the `.sln` file instead.
