Dolittle is a decentralized, distributed, event-driven microservice platform built to harness the power of events.

This is our C# SDK, install it with:
```shell
dotnet add package Dolittle.SDK 
```

# Get Started
- Try our [tutorial](https://dolittle.io/docs/tutorials/)
- Check out our [documentation](https://dolittle.io)


## Building
```shell
dotnet build
```

## Running
```shell
cd Source/Server
dotnet run
```

## Visual Studio

You can open the `.sln` file in the root of the repository and just build directly.

## VSCode

We have readymade tasks for VSCode. Press `F1` and type `Run Tasks` and select `Tasks: Run Tasks` to see the tasks.
They are folder sensitive and will look for the nearest `.csproj` file based on the file you have open.
If it doesn't find it, it will pick the `.sln` file instead.
